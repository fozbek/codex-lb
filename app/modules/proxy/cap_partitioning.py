"""Cluster-wide account concurrency cap partitioning.

Configured per-account concurrency caps are cluster-wide targets. Each replica
derives its own deterministic share locally from the same sorted active
bridge-ring member list, so there is no cross-replica mutable shared state and
no per-request database I/O: every replica computes `floor(cap / R)` plus one
extra slot when its rank falls below `cap mod R`.

Membership changes are adopted with hysteresis keyed on whether this
replica's share could actually grow: a rank's share is monotone non-increasing
in both the replica count and the rank, so only a count decrease or a move to
an earlier rank (including mixed churn where new members appear while
lower-ranked ids vanish) can grow it. Changes that cannot grow the share are
adopted on the next refresh, while any potentially share-growing change is
adopted only after that exact pending partition (count and rank) has been
observed continuously for a configured stability window — a different pending
partition restarts the window — so neither a missed heartbeat nor a rolling
replacement can transiently inflate a survivor's share.
