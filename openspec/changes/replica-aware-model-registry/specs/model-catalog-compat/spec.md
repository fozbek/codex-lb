# model-catalog-compat delta: replica-aware-model-registry

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Refreshed model catalog is replica-coherent

The leader refresh cycle SHALL persist the complete registry state (models, plan maps, per-account tier maps, suppression set, authoritative flags, metadata retention state, and the refresh wall-clock timestamp) to the single-row `model_registry_snapshot` table and SHALL bump the `model_registry` cache-invalidation namespace only after the persist commits (write-then-bump). The payload write and the bump SHALL be skipped when the serialized content hash is unchanged from the last persisted state; the stored `refreshed_at` timestamp SHALL still be advanced so snapshot age reflects the leader's latest successful refresh. Every replica MUST apply a newly persisted snapshot within the cache-invalidation poll bound and MUST invalidate its local account-selection cache on apply; after apply, `/v1/models`, plan gating (`plan_types_for_model`), suppression (`is_suppressed_model`), and per-account service-tier routing on a non-leader MUST be identical to the leader. A non-leader refresh tick MUST NOT fetch the upstream catalog and SHALL instead reconcile from the persisted snapshot when the stored snapshot header differs from the last applied one (backstop for a lost invalidation bump). A leader catalog clear SHALL persist an explicit cleared marker and bump, so followers revert to the bootstrap floor rather than serving a withdrawn catalog.

#### Scenario: Follower serves the refreshed catalog on /v1/models

- **GIVEN** replica A (leader) completes a registry refresh whose catalog adds a new slug and withdraws a bootstrap slug
- **AND** replica A persists the snapshot and bumps the `model_registry` namespace
- **WHEN** replica B's cache-invalidation poller observes the version change
- **THEN** replica B applies the snapshot to its in-memory registry
- **AND** `GET /v1/models` served by replica B lists the new slug and omits the withdrawn slug

#### Scenario: Follower enforces suppression of a withdrawn slug

- **GIVEN** the leader's refreshed snapshot marks a previously served slug as suppressed
- **WHEN** a follower applies the persisted snapshot
- **THEN** `is_suppressed_model` returns true for that slug on the follower

#### Scenario: Follower enforces plan gating for a newly gated slug

- **GIVEN** the leader's refreshed snapshot maps a slug to exactly one plan type
- **WHEN** a follower applies the persisted snapshot
- **THEN** `plan_types_for_model` on the follower returns exactly that plan set instead of no filtering

#### Scenario: Catalog clear propagates to followers

- **GIVEN** the leader clears the registry because no active accounts remain
- **WHEN** the leader persists the cleared marker and bumps, and a follower applies it
- **THEN** the follower reverts to the bootstrap catalog floor

#### Scenario: Lost bump converges via the refresh-tick backstop

- **GIVEN** a snapshot was persisted but the invalidation bump was lost
- **WHEN** a non-leader replica's next refresh tick runs
- **THEN** the replica detects the header mismatch, applies the persisted snapshot, and converges within one refresh interval

#### Scenario: Non-leader tick performs no upstream fetch

- **WHEN** a non-leader replica's refresh tick runs
- **THEN** it performs no upstream model-catalog fetch, regardless of whether it reconciled from the store

### Requirement: Persisted model catalog survives restart and version skew

At startup every replica SHALL load the persisted model-registry snapshot into its in-memory registry before background schedulers start, provided the snapshot's age is within `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds` (default 86400); an older snapshot SHALL be ignored so the bootstrap catalog remains the floor. A snapshot whose `schema_version` differs from the running code's codec version SHALL be ignored with a warning and MUST NOT fail startup or the invalidation poller (rolling-deploy safety). A persist failure on the leader SHALL degrade to leader-local refresh behavior with a warning (the in-memory registry is still updated and persistence is retried next cycle). Imported snapshots SHALL preserve refresh-TTL semantics by deriving the monotonic `fetched_at` from the persisted wall-clock `refreshed_at`.

#### Scenario: Restart loads the persisted catalog before the first refresh

- **GIVEN** a fresh persisted snapshot exists
- **WHEN** a replica starts
- **THEN** its registry serves the persisted catalog before the first refresh tick completes

#### Scenario: Snapshot older than the staleness cap is ignored

- **GIVEN** the persisted snapshot's `refreshed_at` is older than `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** a replica starts
- **THEN** the snapshot is not applied and the bootstrap catalog is served
- **AND** the next successful leader refresh repopulates the snapshot

#### Scenario: Mismatched schema version is ignored without error

- **GIVEN** the persisted snapshot's `schema_version` differs from the running code's codec version
- **WHEN** a replica attempts to load it at startup or via the poller
- **THEN** the snapshot is ignored with a warning and no error is raised

#### Scenario: Leader persist failure keeps the leader serving its refreshed catalog

- **GIVEN** the leader's registry refresh succeeded but persisting the snapshot fails
- **WHEN** the refresh cycle completes
- **THEN** the leader's in-memory registry still serves the refreshed catalog and a warning is logged

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Bootstrap model catalog is available before refresh

Before the first successful upstream model-registry refresh, the system MUST
serve a conservative static catalog of known Codex model slugs from both
`GET /v1/models` and `GET /backend-api/codex/models`. This static catalog is a
bundled fallback for startup/offline paths; refreshed upstream model-registry
data remains the authoritative source once available. A replica that starts
while a fresh persisted registry snapshot exists SHALL serve the persisted
catalog (not the bootstrap catalog) before its first scheduler tick; the
bootstrap catalog remains the floor only when no persisted or refreshed
snapshot is available. The bootstrap catalog MUST
include `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`,
`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`,
`gpt-5.2`, and `codex-auto-review`, and MUST NOT invent unverified variant
slugs such as `gpt-5.5-pro` or a bare `gpt-5.6`. `gpt-5.3-codex` and
`gpt-5.3-codex-spark` were dropped from upstream's bundled catalog at
codex rust-v0.144.x but remain retained for older pinned clients because the
upstream backend still serves them.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible models endpoint serves bootstrap slugs

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted registry snapshot is available
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response contains exactly the bootstrap model slugs
- **AND** the response includes `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`
- **AND** the response does not include `gpt-5.5-pro` or bare `gpt-5.6`

#### Scenario: Codex-native models endpoint serves GPT-5.6 bootstrap metadata

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` entries include representative upstream metadata including context-window, visibility, speed-tier, and reasoning fields
- **AND** Sol and Terra advertise `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra`
- **AND** Luna advertises `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`

#### Scenario: Replica startup with a fresh persisted snapshot serves the persisted catalog

- **GIVEN** a fresh persisted registry snapshot exists whose catalog differs from the bootstrap catalog
- **WHEN** a replica starts and a client calls `GET /v1/models` before the first refresh tick
- **THEN** the response reflects the persisted catalog, not the bootstrap catalog
